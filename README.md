## Description

This is a simple JS + CSS application displaying the current time in the form of an analog clock. It uses CSS transform effects alongside JS to achieve this effect. Writing this app helped me:

<li>Learn more about CSS transform effects</li>
<li>Learn more about working with current time and date.</li>
<li>Practice writing JS code, such as query selectors and functions.</li>
<li>Practice GitHub workflow </li><br>

## Usage
